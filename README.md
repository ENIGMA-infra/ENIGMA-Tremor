# Welcome to the ENIGMA-Tremor Repository!

ENIGMA-Tremor aims to leverage existing neuroimaging and genetics data from cohorts around the world to identify, characterize and explain how brain alterations are linked to tremor symptoms, subtypes and disease progression. More specifically, we aim to:
- Determine how symptoms associated with tremor, such as gait problems, cognitive decline, dystonic posturing and asymmetry, are correlated to structural and functional imaging markers.
- Identify differential and common neuroimaging signatures across subtypes and compared to controls.
- Determine the relationship between brain structure and function and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions (e.g., DBS and FUS).
