Its goal is to help users adopt the FAIR principles and improve the reproducibility of studies. </p> <p>The ongoing collaboration between the ENIGMA-PD team and Nipoppy team has streamlined data curation, processing, and analysis workflows, which significantly simplifies tracking of data availability, addition of new pipelines and upgrading of existing pipelines. The ENIGMA-Tremor and Nipoppy team is available to support and guide users through the process of implementing the framework, ensuring a smooth transition. To join the Nipoppy support community, we recommend joining their Discord channel. Here you can ask questions and find answers while working with Nipoppy. </p> <p>For more information, see the Nipoppy documentation.</p>"},{"location":"projects/ongoing/Cortical_Subcortical_Cerebellum_Morphology_Project/#2a-running-freesurfer-7","title":"2a) Running FreeSurfer 7","text":"<p>When you reach this point, the hardest part is behind you and we can finally come to the real stuff.

Since you\u2019ve all just been through fMRIPrep in Nipoppy, this next step will feel familiar as running this pipeline follows a very similar workflow.</p> <p>About the pipeline: This pipeline uses existing FreeSurfer 7 functionalities to extract subnuclei volumes from subcortical regions like the thalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. It requires completed FreeSurfer output (<code>recon-all</code>) and integrates the subsegmentation outputs directly into the existing <code>/mri</code> and <code>/stats</code> directories. Additionally, the pipeline will perform Sequence Adaptive Multimodal SEGmentation (SAMSEG) on T1w images in order to calculate a superior intracranial volume.</p>"},{"location":"projects/ongoing/Cortical_Subcortical_Cerebellum_Morphology_Project/#2b-quality-assessment","title":"2b) Quality Assessment","text":""},{"location":"projects/ongoing/Cortical_Subcortical_Cerebellum_Morphology_Project/#part-1-running-the-fs-qc-toolbox-link-to-instructions","title":"Part 1: Running the FS-QC toolbox: Link to instructions","text":"<p>Congratulations, you made it to the quality assessment!

Even small errors or artifacts in images can lead to big mistakes in analysis and interpretation, so careful checks help us to verify whether we can savely include a certain region of interest or participant in our analysis. For the FreeSurfer output, we will follow standardized ENIGMA instructions on how to decide on the quality of the cortical and subcortical segmentations.</p> <p>At this stage, visual quality assessment of the subsegmentations (e.g., thalamic or hippocampal nuclei) is not required, as there are no established protocols yet and the process would be highly time-consuming; statistical checks (e.g., outlier detection) can be used instead. This may be followed up at a later stage, once there is a project that specifically focuses on these outcomes and the necessary anatomical expertise is available to develop a dedicated quality control manual.</p> <p>You can find the updated ENIGMA-PD QC instructions for visual inspection here.</p>"},{"location":"projects/ongoing/Cortical_Subcortical_Cerebellum_Morphology_Project/#3-running-the-cerebellum-segmentations-using-cerebnet","title":"3) Running the cerebellum segmentations using CerebNet","text":"<p> The protocol is being finalized and will be added soon!</p>"},{"location":"projects/ongoing/Cortical_Subcortical_Cerebellum_Morphology_Project/#4-data-sharing","title":"4) Data sharing","text":"<p>After completing all of the above steps, you're ready to share your derived data with the ENIGMA-Tremor core team.
